## What is this?
This is a ccs I recently converted from a standard KoL BALLS macro I've
been cultivating over the course of several years. It'll utilize a
variety of reusable combat items, so you don't feel bad about letting
them gather dust in the corner of your inventory. It'll also use a
variety of staggering skills and other useful things, and make progress
on a decent number of quests.

It also takes the stance that if you have something equipped that grants
limited use of a combat skill, you have it equipped because you want to
use it. Don't use this ccs while you have something like that equipped
if you want to use it on a specific enemy. Except for things that you
would very obviously care about what enemy you used it on, like limited
banishes.
